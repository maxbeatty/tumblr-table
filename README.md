tumblr-table
============

Convert data into Tumblr-allowed markup to display as a table.

From [Tumblr's help](http://www.tumblr.com/help) documents:
> ##Why isn't my post being formatted correctly on the Dashboard?
We try to filter post formatting on the Dashboard for a clean user experience. Forms, tables, CSS, Javascript, and other content may be stripped. If you see something thatâ€™s really weird, feel free to drop us a line.
##Why isn't my post being formatted correctly on my blog?
Tumblr's rich-text editor doesn't support certain advanced HTML/CSS code. You may need to use the Plain Text Editor to create advanced post embeds or to control the formatting of post text and media via HTML. You can switch to the Plain Text Editor on your Preferences page.

Tables have been abused over the years, but they are still the best way to display tabular data.

This tool will help you customize your Tumblr theme and generate some wacky HTML so you can display tabular data on your tumblog.
